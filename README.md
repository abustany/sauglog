# Sauglog

ðŸ‘‰ A simple, privacy-first breastfeeding logger

Sauglog is a simple mobile application to log when and how you breastfeed your
baby. It keeps all data stored locally and does not communicate with any
servers. There are no advertisement, no analytics. Any data you enter stays on
your phone.

Pull requests are welcome. This is a standard Vite/Vue/Typescript project, use
`yarn dev` to start the development server. A minimal suite of E2E tests is
maintained in the `cypress/` folder.

The code was more cobbled together than properly engineered, expect quirks here
and there. It uses a random mix of Vue's options and composition API, I guess
the latter should be favoured in new code.
